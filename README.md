# Fake Ah Rythm

A nostalgic clone of Discord music bot, Rythm. This bot simulates the behavior of Rythm by utilizing Spotify for music playback.

## Disclaimer

This project is a rudimentary alternative for nostalgic purposes. It directly affects your Spotify playback, and the audio can be routed to a Discord channel using a virtual audio cable. Please note that this is not a perfect replacement for the original Rythm bot.

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by the original Rythm bot, which is now defunct. Credits to the Rythm team for their contributions to the Discord music bot community.
